The official repository for Iowa State University Computer Science &amp; Software Engineering (CSE) Club's website.

The website began development in the fall of 2022 in an effort to draw a greater presence to the CSE club and bring members together in a collaborative project.  Still undergoing development into the forseeable future, this is an opportunity for students of the club to show off the many skills they posess and to learn new ones.

Developed by students in the CSE Club.
